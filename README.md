For Python Code Contributers Follow: http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/

Pylint Description : 

Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells. 
It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored 
and can offer you details about the code's complexity.

Run: 
pip install pylint

pylint [filename]

For JavaScript Code Contributers Follow: https://standardjs.com/

JavaScript Standard Style Description:

The beauty of JavaScript Standard Style is that it's simple. No one wants to maintain 
multiple hundred-line style configuration files for every module/project they work on. 
Enough of this madness!

Run:

npx standard --fix
